# Weather App

This is a front end project built as part of FreeCodeCamp's cirriculum. The website tells users the weather around them, their location, and the time with the use of the Geolocation API and the Forecast.io API. The user can also search for any other location. The background color changes based on the weather. 

## Built With

* [Forecast.io API](https://darksky.net/) - The api used to get the weather based on location. 
* [Geolocation API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/intro) - The api used to get the location of the User based on their IP.
