# Weather App

This is a front end project built as part of FreeCodeCamp's cirriculum. The website tells users the weather around them, their location, and the time with the use of the Geolocation API and the Forecast.io API. The user can also search for any other location. The background color changes based on the weather. 

## User Stories

### FreeCodeCamp

* User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.
* User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
* User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

### Personal User Stories

* User Story: I can tell the general weather by the background alone
* User Story: I can search for the weather in a different location
* User Story: I can see the general weather for the next 7 days
* User Story: By weather, I personally take it as: temperature, preceived temperature, today's high and low, cloudiness, rain intensity, wind intensity, the summary of the day, and general forecast. Also showing the location and the time because I can. 

## Built With

* [Forecast.io API](https://darksky.net/) - The api used to get the weather based on location. 
* [Geolocation API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/intro) - The api used to get the location of the User based on their IP.
